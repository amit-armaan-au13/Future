i)	What are the major features of Reactjs?
        Reactjs is a singlePage Application, i.e it doesn't need to reload the page again , if some changes happened in our Component.
        It provides the solution of reloading all the components data, as in case of other frontend tools(jquery,ajax).

ii)    	How is Element and Component different?
            ELements are like <input>,<p>,<h1>...etc. which id the basic buildings of the html.
            COMPONENTS: There are the basic block of React, as we also used to sday that in react everything is component.
                        In react the function returns and renders the component.

iii)     	What are the different phases of component lifecycle?

                The react is having life cycles which plays an important role, in maintaining the functionality of react.These are:
                ComponentDidMount()
                Render()
                ComponentDidUpdate()
                ComponentWillUnmount()
                And few lifecycles are not much used as:
                componentShouldUpdate()
                

        iv)   	What are the lifecycle methods of React?
                The react lifecycle methods are responsible for rendering the component on the screen, if there is some change, and
                 update in state/props of the component.
                 Eg: ComponentDidMount()
                     Render()
                     ComponentDidUpdate()
                    ComponentWillUnmount()
        
        v)      5.	What are different ways to create components in ReactJS?

                    The react component can be created in two ways:
                    1)Class Based Component
                    2)Function Based Component.

                NODEJS:

        i)     What is NodeJs and what is usage?

                NodeJs is a technique through which we can run out code on our own localmachine, i.e, we need not to open
                webPage to render the result. It uses V8 engine of googleChrome.
        
        
        ii)   What is the use of NODE_ENV?


        iii) What is Event loop in NodeJS and how does it works?

            Event loop is responsible for storing the requested the task, which is asked by the client, it will store all the
            asynchoronous task and perform one by one, after the completion of one task it will go and check the container where 
            it stored tasks, and perform again the next task, till the eventLoop gets empty.


        iv)  What is the difference between aynchronous and non-blocking?
            asynchoronous :- Bydefault JavaScript is synchronous in nature, but if we want to make JavaScript works asynchoronously
            then we can do it by the help of (async,await).It will wait till the task get completed and after resolving the promises,
            returned , it will execute the next task.

            Non-Blocking: - Non Blocking means the node thread will not be prevented by doing the next task in queue, it will keep 
            on performing, without waiting for any promises to be resolved.

            v) Differentiate between readFile vs createREadStream in nodejs?
               
               readFile:- readFile is a object inside the 'fs' of Node.it is used to read the data from the given locations, 
               and if the data is read succesfully, then it will return the data, else it will return the error, occoured while
               reading the data.

               createREadStream:-It will create a stream in node object which will read the data from the given location.
